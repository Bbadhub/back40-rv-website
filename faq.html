We don't have water/sewer hookups at individual sites, tent camping areas, or facilities for non-self-contained setups. This allows us to keep rates low and maintain a quiet, low-impact environment. If your RV has holding tanks and can operate without full hookups, you're welcome! Our dump station and water fill are easily accessible.</p>

                            <p>Back40 RV Park offers three electrical service options to accommodate any RV: <strong>50 amp, 30 amp, and 20 amp hookups</strong>. Most modern RVs use 30 or 50 amp service. If you have a 50 amp RV and the site has 30 amp, you'll need a dogbone adapter (50 to 30 amp). Same for 30 amp RVs at 20 amp sites. Adapters are available at any RV supply store. Let us know your amperage needs when booking.</p>
