**To change password:**
1. Open `admin/login.html` in text editor
2. Find line 153-154:
   ```javascript
   if (password === 'back40admin2025' || password === 'Mark2025!') {
   ```

### Progress Tracking
- Your checklist progress is saved in **browser localStorage**
- Data stays on your computer (not uploaded anywhere)
- If you clear browser data, progress will reset
- To backup progress: Browser stores it automatically per device

### NAP Consistency (Critical!)
**NAP = Name, Address, Phone**

Use this EXACT format everywhere:
```
Back40 RV Park
1373 Hickory Lane
Pineville, MO 64856
(479) 721-5630

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to complete all tasks?
**A:** No! Focus on "Week 1" (critical) tasks first. Others are optional but helpful.

### Q: Can I skip some directories?
**A:** Yes. Focus on:
1. Google Business Profile (most important!)
2. Bing Places
3. Yelp
4. TripAdvisor
5. Campendium (RV-specific)

Others are "nice to have" but not required.

### Q: How long does each task take?
**A:**
- Google Search Console: 15 minutes
- Google Business Profile: 30 minutes + 5-7 days for postcard
- Bing: 10 minutes
- Each directory: 10-15 minutes
- Getting 10 reviews: 1-2 hours

### Q: What if I get stuck?
**A:** Contact Brett for help. Most common issues:
- Google Business Profile verification (postcard takes 5-7 days)
- Website verification for Search Console (may need file upload)

### Q: Can I hire someone to do this?
**A:** Yes, but it's not necessary. This dashboard makes it easy to do yourself. Save $500-2000/month in agency fees!

### Q: Is Moz Local worth $14/month?
**A:** For ONE location, probably not urgent. You can manually submit to the 10 most important directories (about 3 hours total). Moz Local automates 45+ directories - useful if you don't want to spend the time.

### Q: What about Good Sam ($300/year)?
**A:** Good Sam is a premium RV directory highly trusted by RVers. It's worth considering after you complete the free listings and see results. Not required initially.
